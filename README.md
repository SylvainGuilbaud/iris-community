# IRIS Community

It provides tools and frameworks for building scalable, high-performance solutions.

## .env File

The `.env` file defines environment variables used by `docker-compose.yml` to configure your IRIS deployment. Typical variables include:

- `IMAGE_IRIS`: Specifies the Docker image for the IRIS instance. This variable lets you manage the version and edition of IRIS used in your deployment, such as Extended Maintenance (EM), Continuous Delivery (CD), or Preview (upcoming) releases. Adjusting `IMAGE_IRIS` ensures consistency across environments and makes it easy to switch between these editions as needed.
- `IRIS_DATA_DIRECTORY`: Sets the directory path for IRIS data storage.
- `ISC_CPF_MERGE_FILE`: Specifies a custom CPF (configuration parameter file) to merge with the default configuration.
- `IRIS_MGR_PORT`: Configures the management port for the IRIS instance.
- `IRIS_WEB_PORT`: Sets the web server port for IRIS.
- `IRIS_PASSWORD`: Sets the password for the IRIS instance's default user. Use a strong password and keep it secure.

Example `.env` file:
```
IRIS_DATA_DIRECTORY=./data
ISC_CPF_MERGE_FILE=./custom.cpf
IRIS_MGR_PORT=51773
IRIS_WEB_PORT=52773
IRIS_PASSWORD=yourStrongPasswordHere
```

These variables allow you to customize your deployment without modifying the compose file directly. Keep sensitive information secure and avoid committing the `.env` file to version control.
